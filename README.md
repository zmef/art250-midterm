notes and stuff

1. The Moon (0.0000001 light-years)
Base Price: $5
"A quick jaunt to the neighborhood."
Perfect for sending a care package to your cousin who thinks they’re an astronaut. The Moon’s practically a hop, skip, and a jump away, but you’ll have to worry about space dust in the airlock. Also, don't forget the space snacks!
2. Mars (0.00015 light-years)
Base Price: $50
"Red, rocky, and a little bit chilly."
The base for your Martian vacation home. It’ll take a bit longer to get there, but no problem! Mars is a popular destination for interplanetary tourists, so expect some competition for space. Plus, you might get some of that special Martian dust on your package—don’t worry, it's harmless… probably.
3. Venus (0.00026 light-years)
Base Price: $100
"When you need to send a package to a fiery hot mess."
Venus is hot, acidic, and has an atmosphere thicker than a space burrito. It’s an extreme destination, but there’s always a tiny chance your package will survive the journey through the clouds of sulfuric acid. Extra insurance suggested!
4. Jupiter (0.00048 light-years)
Base Price: $250
"Big, gas giant... and possibly unpredictable."
Sending something to Jupiter means navigating through a thick atmosphere of swirling gases, lightning storms, and insane gravity. But hey, we have a great deal with the Jovian shipping lanes. You may not get there quickly, but you’ll be the talk of the cloud cities once your package arrives.
5. Saturn (0.00092 light-years)
Base Price: $300
"Fancy rings, minimal delivery delays."
Saturn is beautiful and very photogenic. Sending a package here is like sending a gift to a cosmic diva. Delivery is usually pretty smooth, but, uh, don’t forget to account for the rings—sometimes they can get a little bouncy.
6. Alpha Centauri (4.3 light-years)
Base Price: $10,000
"The closest star system. Still a long way from home."
Neighboring stars may seem close in the grand scheme of the galaxy, but this still means a long, long haul. Expect this to be a week-long delivery (just don’t look at the quantum entanglement shipping option, we don’t talk about that one).
7. The Andromeda Galaxy (2.537 million light-years)
Base Price: $1,000,000
"Not for the faint of heart."
It’s one of the closest galaxies to ours, but let’s be real, it’s still 2.5 million light-years away. That’s one expensive intergalactic trip, and delivery times may vary. The delivery may take a few years, or perhaps a few millennia—maybe you’ll get it before the next Big Bang!
8. The Great Attractor (150 million light-years)
Base Price: $50,000,000
"You’re really reaching now, aren’t you?"
This is the mysterious, supermassive gravitational anomaly at the center of the universe. It attracts galaxies toward it with an invisible force that no one fully understands. Your package might get pulled in before it even arrives, but hey, the ride’s worth it!
9. The Edge of the Universe (13.8 billion light-years)
Base Price: $999,999,999.99
"Would you like this shipped beyond time and space?"
Shipping to the very edge of the observable universe is not for the faint of heart—or wallet. This is real deep space, where cosmic mysteries unfold, and time slows down. Your package may arrive right after the universe ends (or at least, right before). Either way, you'll be first in line when they start shipping packages back.
10. The Multiverse (∞ light-years)
Base Price: "Name Your Price"
"We don’t even know if your package will exist in this universe."
Send your package to any of the infinite universes within the multiverse. Who knows where it’ll land or if it’ll even exist in this timeline? Will you get a version of yourself who remembers getting the package? No one knows. Buyer beware.
Bonus Options:
Local Galactic Speed (within your galaxy) – 10% off, just keep it within your own galactic neighborhood.
Interdimensional Shipping (Multi-Dimensional) – 30% additional surcharge. Dimension-hopping is complicated, trust us.
Asteroid Belt Detour – +25% for extra space adventures.
Notes on Pricing:
Prices are subject to quantum fluctuations. Your rate may change depending on cosmic events, solar flares, or the alignment of the stars.
Guaranteed delivery not valid in parallel universes.
Insurance may increase if sending packages to black holes, unstable wormholes, or galactic civilizations with “questionable” postal systems.
