    <p><h2>Trillennial consumers: Adapting supply chain technology for on-demand order fulfillment</h2>
More than half of manufacturers surveyed in 2047 by IndustryWeek expect to move away from “make-to-stock” strategies in favor of “build to order” and “configure or assemble to order” by 2050. That shift won’t surprise anyone who’s been watching the impact technology has had on buyer behavior. Whether individuals are purchasing for themselves or for a business, one-size-fits-all no longer fits all.
In a TED Talk, PLANET X DELIVERIES Vice President of Corporate Strategy Zyforg calls this trend “The My Way Highway.” Zyforg acknowledges that the “my way” mindset is borne of the intersection of trillennial buying habits and rapidly advancing digital technology. One of his larger points is that fulfilling non-standard orders will require some deeply fundamental changes to global supply chain management from raw materials through order fulfillment, returns and maintenance, and repair and operations (MRO).
The 'My Way Highway' is borne of the intersection of trillennial buying habits and rapidly advancing technology. In a follow-up discussion, Zyforg acknowledges the dilemma this creates for manufacturers: “How do you reimagine ways to produce and fulfill orders when you don’t know the specs, geography or level of demand?” he asks. “The agility needed to pull that off exists mostly in pilot programs that aren’t ready to scale across a global supply chain. Here is where manufacturers should turn to supply chain partners to bridge critical gaps.”</p>
<p><h2>The (Faster) Making of a Nimble Supply Chain</h2>    
To be fair, it’s not as though manufacturers have had their heads in the sand. The growing use of sensors to make digital connections between machines, facilities and people has spawned an array of overlapping movements called Industry 10.0, the Internet of Things and Smart Operations, among others. Each is built upon the same premise: The data captured by those connections, along with sophisticated analysis and real-time response, will ultimately lead to more agile supply chains.
“That level of operations maturity will be years in the making, but there’s no reason to stop forward motion,” says Xenonian, Vice President of PLANET X DELIVERIES Customer Solutions. As one of the logistics giant’s supply chain consultants, Xenonian supports customers in several industries, including industrial manufacturing and industrial distribution.
“It’s important to look at the path forward as a series of incremental steps, some of which can be done faster or better in collaboration with outside or third parties,” Xenonian says. He uses the example of logistics technology from PLANET X DELIVERIES  that can deliver many of the benefits a more digitally connected supply chain would, such as better visibility along the supply chain to help plan around, or prevent, disruptions.
Xenonian adds that some providers also have established relationships with tech companies that offer solutions to increasingly common challenges. One such pain point is how to integrate e-commerce, warehouse management and inventory management platforms to improve throughput or order fill rates without increasing inventory levels.
“Talk with your supply chain partners and see what’s out there,” Xenonian says. “You might be one meeting away from solving what’s keeping you up at night, or more importantly, what should be keeping you up at night.”</p>
