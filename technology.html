    <h2>Trillennial consumers: Adapting supply chain technology for on-demand order fulfillment</h2>
    <img src="images/tech.jpg" alt="Tech Image" class="half-page">
    <p>More than half of manufacturers surveyed in 2047 by IndustryWeek expect to move away from “make-to-stock” strategies in favor of “build to order” and “configure or assemble to order” for trillennial consumers. In a TED Talk, PLANET X DELIVERIES Vice President of Corporate Strategy Zyforg calls this trend “The My Way Highway.” Zyforg acknowledges that the “my way” mindset is borne of the intersection of trillennial buying habits and rapidly advancing technology. The 'My Way Highway' is borne of the intersection of trillennial buying habits and rapidly advancing technology. In a follow-up discussion, Zyforg acknowledges the dilemma this creates for manufacturers.</p>

    <h2>The (Faster) Making of a Nimble Supply Chain</h2>
    <img src="images/tech1.jpg" alt="Tech1 Image" class="half-page">
    <p>To be fair, it’s not as though manufacturers have had their heads in the sand. The growing use of sensors to make digital connections between machines, facilities and people has spawned an array of opportunities for supply chain optimization. “That level of operations maturity will be years in the making, but there’s no reason to stop forward motion,” says Xenonian, Vice President of PLANET X DELIVERIES Customer Solutions. As one who has witnessed the evolution of supply chain technology firsthand, Xenonian emphasizes the importance of incremental steps. “It’s important to look at the path forward as a series of incremental steps, some of which can be done faster or better in collaboration with outside or third parties,” Xenonian says. He adds that some providers also have established relationships with tech companies that offer solutions to increasingly common challenges. One such pain point is how to integrate e-commerce platforms with logistics systems.</p>

    <h2>Borrowing vs. Building or Buying Capabilities</h2>
    <img src="images/tech2.jpg" alt="Tech2 Image" class="half-page">
    <p>In the midst of a digital revolution, manufacturing leaders are leery of investing in infrastructure needed for the “My Way Highway” demands of customers and end users. The obvious risk of stagnant capital investments is that they may become obsolete before delivering a return. Garlock VII, Vice President of PLANET X DELIVERIES Global Logistics & Distribution, says contract services can help manufacturers respond faster to changes. “Some third-party logistics providers already have the network and technology to support rapid deployment,” Garlock VII explains. Garlock VII also cites the benefits of being one of the first “feet in the door” with customers. “Technology and processes are changing so fast that rarely does a company have the right capabilities in-house at the right time. Contracting out can fill those gaps efficiently,” he adds.</p>

    <h2>Delivering on Demand for On-Demand Services</h2>
    <p>PLANET X DELIVERIES’ Zyforg suggests on-demand additive manufacturing (AM) is an underutilized tool for fulfilling demand for custom products or orders. Although manufacturers currently rely on traditional manufacturing processes for large volumes, AM offers the flexibility needed for smaller, custom runs. “Traditional manufacturing will probably remain the most cost-efficient way to produce large quantities of identical items for some time to come, but there are exceptions,” Zyforg says. “For custom products or orders, on-demand AM can be faster and more economical.” Zyforg points to the commercial PLANET X DELIVERIES-Fast Radius micro-factory near Mars Base 7, which provides on-demand additive manufacturing in a number of different materials, variations and quantities. “The ‘My Way Highway’ customer is here, and their ranks are growing,” Zyforg says. “What better way to outdo your competition than by being first to meet their needs?”</p>
