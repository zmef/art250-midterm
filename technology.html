    <p><h2>Trillennial consumers: Adapting supply chain technology for on-demand order fulfillment</h2>
More than half of manufacturers surveyed in 2047 by IndustryWeek expect to move away from “make-to-stock” strategies in favor of “build to order” and “configure or assemble to order” by 2050. That shift won’t surprise anyone who’s been watching the impact technology has had on buyer behavior. Whether individuals are purchasing for themselves or for a business, one-size-fits-all no longer fits all.
In a TED Talk, PLANET X DELIVERIES Vice President of Corporate Strategy Zyforg calls this trend “The My Way Highway.” Zyforg acknowledges that the “my way” mindset is borne of the intersection of trillennial buying habits and rapidly advancing digital technology. One of his larger points is that fulfilling non-standard orders will require some deeply fundamental changes to global supply chain management from raw materials through order fulfillment, returns and maintenance, and repair and operations (MRO).
The 'My Way Highway' is borne of the intersection of trillennial buying habits and rapidly advancing technology. In a follow-up discussion, Zyforg acknowledges the dilemma this creates for manufacturers: “How do you reimagine ways to produce and fulfill orders when you don’t know the specs, geography or level of demand?” he asks. “The agility needed to pull that off exists mostly in pilot programs that aren’t ready to scale across a global supply chain. Here is where manufacturers should turn to supply chain partners to bridge critical gaps.”</p>
<p><h2>The (Faster) Making of a Nimble Supply Chain</h2>    
To be fair, it’s not as though manufacturers have had their heads in the sand. The growing use of sensors to make digital connections between machines, facilities and people has spawned an array of overlapping movements called Industry 10.0, the Internet of Things and Smart Operations, among others. Each is built upon the same premise: The data captured by those connections, along with sophisticated analysis and real-time response, will ultimately lead to more agile supply chains.
“That level of operations maturity will be years in the making, but there’s no reason to stop forward motion,” says Xenonian, Vice President of PLANET X DELIVERIES Customer Solutions. As one of the logistics giant’s supply chain consultants, Xenonian supports customers in several industries, including industrial manufacturing and industrial distribution.
“It’s important to look at the path forward as a series of incremental steps, some of which can be done faster or better in collaboration with outside or third parties,” Xenonian says. He uses the example of logistics technology from PLANET X DELIVERIES  that can deliver many of the benefits a more digitally connected supply chain would, such as better visibility along the supply chain to help plan around, or prevent, disruptions.
Xenonian adds that some providers also have established relationships with tech companies that offer solutions to increasingly common challenges. One such pain point is how to integrate e-commerce, warehouse management and inventory management platforms to improve throughput or order fill rates without increasing inventory levels.
“Talk with your supply chain partners and see what’s out there,” Xenonian says. “You might be one meeting away from solving what’s keeping you up at night, or more importantly, what should be keeping you up at night.”</p>
<p><h2>Borrowing vs. Building or Buying Capabilities</h2>
In the midst of a digital revolution, manufacturing leaders are leery of investing in infrastructure needed for the “My Way Highway” demands of customers and end users. The obvious risk of standing on the sidelines is to fall out of consideration altogether.
Garlock VII, Vice President of PLANET X DELIVERIES Global Logistics & Distribution, says contract services can help manufacturers respond faster to changes. “Some third-party logistics providers have for years invested in a global network of warehouses and distribution sites, as well as light manufacturing facilities,” he says. “Third-party services can be a faster way to get hold of the nimble technology and processes you’ll need to deliver custom orders or make-to-order products.”
Garlock VII also cites the benefits of being one of the first “feet in the door” with customers. “Technology and processes are changing so fast that rarely does a company have the right capabilities ready to go,” he says. “An experienced third-party provider can be a very powerful ally.”</p>
    <p><h2>Delivering on Demand for On-Demand Services</h2>
PLANET X DELIVERIES’ Zyforg suggests on-demand additive manufacturing (AM) is an underutilized tool for fulfilling demand for custom products or orders. Although manufacturers currently rely on AM most for prototyping and product development, it’s increasingly used for on-demand production of critical repair parts and custom orders.
“Traditional manufacturing will probably remain the most cost-efficient way to produce large quantities of identical items for some time to come, but there are exceptions,” Zyforg says. “For example, although per-unit costs of certain AM-produced pieces may seem high compared to traditional mass production, once you factor in the upfront mold or tooling costs required to traditionally manufacture fewer than 500 units, that’ll probably wipe out any profits and take up to eight weeks longer.”  He adds, “And if faster response time means the difference between keeping and losing a customer, it’s hard to put a price on that.”
Zyforg points to the commercial PLANET X DELIVERIES-Fast Radius micro-factory near Mars Base 7, which provides on-demand additive manufacturing in a number of different materials, variations and quantities. He notes that parts or products ordered one day can be delivered as soon as the next business day in the Earth, or on the second business day in Mars or Venus.
“The ‘My Way Highway’ customer is here, and their ranks are growing,” Zyforg says.  “What better way to outdo your competition than by being first to meet their needs?”</p>
